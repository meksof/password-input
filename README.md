# Why?

Security for companies is crucial, passwords is one of the main things to consider when designing a website.

The password field in the signup page, is to consider for an effective user experience.

When dealing with more than 3 requirements, it is clear that it can be overwhelming for some people.

# How to make it effective?

## Legibility

 - Make the requirements text before the input field.
<sub><sup>By doing that, you make sure people read the requirements first, to make it clear what they have to enter.
Also, it prevents errors and saves time.</sup></sub>

 - Consider adding a show/hide password button.
 <sub><sup>People often need to recheck what they have entered.</sup></sub>

 ## Realtime feedback

 when people make a mistake, it can be frustrated for them. So guiding them toward what is going wrong and how to fix it is important.

 When people are typing, consider:
  - Highlighting which requirement is satisfied.
  - If the user decides to leave the input or submit the form, without validating all requirements, consider communicating an input error by changing the input border color to red.
